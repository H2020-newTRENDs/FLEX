## Start something new

I just set up this github page for our project. I though it could be fancy and we could use it as a notebook or something. Later, we develop our documentation here. However, it turns out that the page cannot be set as "private". 

I upgraded my account just for this.

Fine, I will leave it here for now and see how we could use it.



Just moved some content from the Readme.md here:

### Coding Conventions

#### 1 Naming convention

- ***variable***: **V**ariable**N**ame
- ***parameter defined in a function***: **p**arameter_**n**ame
- ***function***: **calc_B**uilding**S**pace**H**eating**C**ost
- ***table***: register in the REG, then use it in the code

#### 2 Commiting to Github

- First, pull when you start working and make sure you are working on the latest version.
- Second, pull again before pushing, because during your working time, the others may have pushed. However, even though that is the case, the revisions should be merged into your local version automatically, as long as we didn't work on the same row. If you do see the conflicts, solve it locally. ***Always pull before pushing, so that we solve the conflicts locally.***
- Third, after solving the conflict, pull again (it should be "already up to date"), and push super-fast! Hahaha

#### 3 Other conventions

- If you need something from the "Infrastructure", tell Songmin to create them.

### Git Commands

- git pull origin master
- git add .
- git commit -m"***comments for this commit***"
- git push origin master
