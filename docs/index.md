## Start something new

I just set up this github page for our project. I though it could be fancy and we could use it as a notebook or something. Later, we develop our documentation here. However, it turns out that the page cannot be set as "private". 

I upgraded my account just for this.

Fine, I will leave it here for now and see how we could use it.
