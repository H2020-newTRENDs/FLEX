# Coding Convention

#### 1. Naming convention

- variable: VariableName
- parameter: parameter_name
- function: calc_BuildingSpaceHeatingCost
- table: register in the REG, then use it in the code

#### 2. Github cooperation

- remember to pull and push frequently, as long as you are sure that the code is working right
- inform the others if you want to work on their files
- ignore _Database and _Figure folders most time. Only push it when you add more tables in it and push it to the github together. Because it takes a lot of time to push it.
