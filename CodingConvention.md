# Coding Convention

#### 1. Naming convention

- variable: VariableName
- parameter: parameter_name
- function: calc_BuildingSpaceHeatingCost
- table: register in the REG, then use it in the code



#### 2. Github cooperation

- remember to pull and push frequently, as long as you are sure that the code is working right
- inform the others if you want to work on their files
- ignore _Database and _Figure folders most time. Only push it when you add more tables in it and push it to the github together. Because it takes a lot of time to push it. 



#### 3. Common github lines

- git pull origin master
- git add .
- git commit -m"***remark***"
- git push origin master



#### 4. Discussion points

- feedback temperature of water in the radiator
- timeline
- weekly meetings?



#### 5. Next steps

- **Data collection - Philipp and Thomas**: fill in the tables for each OBJ, including the "ID\_" and "Exo\_" tables, then all the "Gen\_" table can be generated.
- **Code review - Philipp and Thomas**: get familiar with the framework and logic
- **Coding - Songmin**: keep working on the files in "B\_Classes" and "C1\_TableGenerator"
- **Coding - Philipp**: work on the "B3\_Building.py"
