A long journey between Philipp, Thomas, and Songmin.


### Next steps and ideas

- behavior generator
- investment decision modeling
- more building types, e.g. multi-family building
- building stock database
- national level aggregation
- energy community

- maximum indoor temperature limitation:
  - set a maximum temperature when the reference heating demand is > 0! (this way it is ensured that the SEMS can 
     not preheat the building in winter) 
    Drawback: In rare cases the heating energy in Spring and Autumn drops to 0 
     when solar radiation is high, and the SEMS preheats the building up to 30Â°C.

  - install a shading system in the model that will reduce the solar gains whenever the temperature would rise above 
    the maximum indoor temperature in the reference model. (not tested jet)
    Drawback: Very general decision for manual/automatic shading system. If we want to include a "smart shading system"
              later, it will not be possible. 

  - install a "cooling" variable that is only used when cooling is turned off. This cooling variable does not cost
    electricity, thus when there is no AC the indoor room temperature will stay below the maximum temperature and 
    the necessary cooling energy to do so is for free. 
    Drawback: In the results the indoor temperature of those scenarios without cooling will not be realistic

DO YOU GUYS HAVE ANY IDEA HOW TO SOLVE THIS? The optimization should not be able to pre-heat the building above 
maximum indoor set temperature, at the same time, when no cooling system is adapted, the maximum indoor set temperature
has to be raised, otherwise the model becomes infeasible.
