# FLEX Model <div id="FLEX_MODEL"/>
This model was created to calculate the energy demand for single buildings
considering consumers, prosumers and prosumagers (a prosumager is a household
which consumes, produces and manages it own energy). The aim is to calculate
the influence of single technology adoptions for individual buildings and 
determine the difference on energy demand when switching from a prosumer to a
consumer. In this model consumer and prosumer are defined as households who 
do not adapt their energy consumption behavior to any outside influence. Indoor
temperature comfort is kept throughout the year. A prosumager on the other hand
rationally tries to minimize the overall operation cost by maximizing PV self-consumption
etc.
