# README

This ***prosumager*** model is developed for ***NewTRENDs Project*** and ***master thesis of Thomas***.



### 1 Milestones

- set up the code and database by the end of May (i.e. ready to run the optimization)

### 2 Next steps

##### 2.1 Songmin

- keep working on the files in "B\_Classes" and "C1\_TableGenerator"

##### 2.2 Thomas

- get familiar with the code and database
- fill in the tables except building

##### 2.3 Philipp

- get familiar with the code and database
- fill in the tables of building
- work on the "B3\_Building.py"

### 3 Coding Convention

##### 3.1 Naming convention

- ***variable***: **V**ariable**N**ame
- ***parameter***: **p**arameter**_n**ame
- ***function***: **calc_B**uilding**S**pace**H**eating**C**ost
- ***table***: register in the REG, then use it in the code

##### 3.2 Github cooperation

- First, pull when you start working and make sure you are working on the latest version.
- Second, pull again before pushing, because during your working time, the others may have pushed. However, even though that is the case, the revisions should be merged into your local version automatically, as long as we didn't work on the same row. If you do see the conflicts, solve it locally. ***Always pull before pushing, so that we solve the conflicts locally.***
- Third, after solving the conflict, pull again (it should be "already up to date"), and push super-fast! Hahaha

### 4 Git Commands

- git pull origin master
- git add .
- git commit -m"***comments for this commit***"
- git push origin master
